                    <h2>TrailBlazerUpKeeper</h2>
                    <p>TrailBlazerUpKeeper is a project I made for the Utah Tech
                        University Building Maintenance crew</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the project was to help keep track of the
                        many paints on campus.</p>
                    <p>Previously Building Maintenance employees had to either
                        remember themselves what a certain room was painted or
                        they just had to guess. I grew frustrated with having to
                        guess and always being wrong. So I built
                        TrailBlazerUpKeeper.</p>
                    <p>If you wanted to check out how I built this, you can
                        click <a href="trailblazerupkeeper.html"
                            style="color:

                    <p>
                        I also have this project deployed, i used render.com
                        which is free so it takes a little while for the backend
                        to show up. You can see it here at <a target="_blank"

                    <h2>Pirates Only</h2>
                    <p>Pirates Only is a project i made for CS-4307 database
                        systems at Utah Tech University.</p>
                    <p>This is a database that I made for in the style of dating
                        service but just for pirates.</p>
                    <p>this is was made using SQL and Python, the UI for this
                        project is just terminal based.</p>
                    <p>if you wanted to check out some of the intresting queries

                    <p>Treelo was the project my group and I made for Utah Techs
                        code school in the summer of 2022.</p>
                    <p>Treelo is a web application that users can use to help
                        keep track of tasks that they need completed. we based
                        this off of an already known app called trello.</p>
                    <p>Treelo uses boards,containers, and cards. To help the
                        users keep track of daily objectives.</p>

                    <h2>Weather Station</h2>
                    <p>This was a project for CS4990 Embedded Systems, where i
                        made a weather station that could read the temperature
                        and
                        humidity in an area and then transmit that data.</p>
                    <p>I made a web application that displays the data on the
                        web and updates in real time.</p>
                    <p>This project uses Lora which allowed for
                        low-power, long-range data transmission to send my data.</p>
