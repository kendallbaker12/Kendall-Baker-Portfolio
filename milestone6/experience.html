                        <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2020 - Present</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conducted repairs and maintenance on various
                                campus buildings.</li>
                            <hr>
                            <li>Responsibilities included patching drywall,
                                painting, maintaining parking lots, moving
                                equipment, and completing other tasks as
                                directed by supervisor.</li>

                            <li>During my time working at Utah Tech, I took the
                                initiative to design and develop a web
                                application that streamlined the process of
                                tracking paints used by the building maintenance
                                crew across campus. This application not only
                                improved the accuracy of paint inventories, but
                                also saved valuable time and resources. Through
                                this project, I gained valuable experience in
                                web development and demonstrated my ability to
                                proactively identify and address operational
                                inefficiencies. You can see more about the
