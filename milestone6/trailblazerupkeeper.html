                            <p>for my senior project while I attended Utah Tech
                                University, I worked part time for the building
                                maintenance crew. One problem I noticed is when
                                repainting walls we never had a way to identify
                                which walls had what types of paints. The only
                                way to know would be to remember the paint or
                                just guess.</p>
                            <p>As part of my senior project, I developed a
                                web-based application using the MERN stack -
                                which is
                                MongoDB, Express, React, and Node - to create a
                                building maintenance management system for Utah
                                Tech University. The system aims to simplify the
                                tracking and management of different types of
                                paints used across the campus, thereby improving
                                the efficiency of the maintenance crew.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To enhance the user interface, I utilized
                                    Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
                                    purposes,
                                    which provided a visually appealing and
                                    user-friendly design.</li>
                                <hr>
                                <li>Through this project, I gained valuable
                                    experience in utilizing new technologies,
                                    such
                                    as React and Tailwind CSS, and demonstrated
                                    my
                                    ability to learn and apply new concepts
                                    quickly.
                                    The project is hosted on a live website at

                            <p>By developing the TrailBlazerUpKeeper project, I
                                demonstrated my proficiency in software
                                development, project management, and
                                problem-solving skills, and I look forward to
